The application features a home page displaying six randomly selected movie titles each time it's loaded, and a recommendation page that shows five recommended movies based on a user search query.

## Features

- **Flask**: Python web framework.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Used for creating the frontend.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design.
